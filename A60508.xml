            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>CHriſtian Reader, How much the Laws of the Church and Kingdom are violated by Papiſts and Sectaries, thou canſt not be ignorant: The ſpreading Contagion of Schiſme and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie doth dilate it ſelf through the whole Land, and the Evil is ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, that to the Worlds eye it ſeemeth Remedileſs and paſt Cure. The ſeveral Sects that have of late days ſprung up, are ſo frequent and common in all places and parts of the Kingdom, and the numbers that adhere to them are ſo many, and the ſtream runs ſo ſtrongly for them, that a toleration hath been thought neceſſary, and Liberty hath been granted to the ſeveral Sectaries to have their Publick Meetings; and it was thought as neceſſary by Rulers and Governours, that the Papiſts likewiſe ſhould have a toleration in their Religion, though they were not permitted to have their Publick Meetings or Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places. The Sectaries of late days having been found as dangerous and pernicious as the Papiſts, and their Practices rather more than leſs Deſtructive to the Publick Peace of the Church and Kingdom. But now His Sacred Majeſty and both Houſes of Parliament, having by joynt Conſent made the Laws of the Church and Kingdom binding to all; and having thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary not to admit of any Toleration, and having Declared againſt all Back-ſliding to Popery or Schiſm. I have aſſumed the boldneſs to manifeſt to the World, that nothing can more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Publick Peace of this Miſerable Diſtracted King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than to have the Laws of the Church and Kingdom Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved without conſenting to any Changes or Alterations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: And hope that this Sermon will find Acceptance of thoſe who are in Authority, and likewiſe of all Pious Chriſtians who are for the Laws of the Church and Kingdom. But yet I do Confeſs, I do after a deſpairing manner ſettle my ſelf to this Task. We have been heretofore, and are ſtill, (by God's juſt permiſſion for our ſins) ſo miſerably Afflicted by Papiſts and Sectaries, that I am out of hopes of prevailing; and were it not ſo, that I did more truſt in Divine help and aſſiſtance, than in Humane, I had never ſet Pen to Paper to Write. In
<pb facs="tcp:50882:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> this clear Light of the Goſpel there could not be ſuch Oppoſition of the Laws of God and the Land as there is, if there were not ſome Papiſts and Sectaries who go againſt their Conſciences, and reſiſt the Truth. But it is to be that there be ſome ſuch amongſt us, who ſtand for the Truth, the Religion, and Laws Eſtabliſhed. The good God open our Eyes to ſee our ſins, and give us Grace to Judge our ſelves, that ſo the time may come, when God may ſee their ſins to be greater than ours; and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and bring to light their Treacherous Practices, their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins, and under-hand workings, ſo as may make for his Glory, the publick Peace of the Church and Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thoſe Ignorant Papiſts and Sectaries, who are fraudulently circumvented, and unawares ſeduced by Crafty Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, who lie in wait to deceive; I pity them, and pray unto God for them, that he would open their Eyes to ſee their Errors, and amend their ſins, and hope that God may touch the Hearts of ſome of them, and cauſe them to give over their ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and iraducing of thoſe who perſwade them to Obedience, and be willing themſelves to be Obedient to the Laws of the Church and Kingdom, and Labour to win others to Submit themſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's ſake: And pray for thoſe, whoſe Hearts deſire and prayer for them is, that they might be Saved. That ſo they, with all Saints, praying for thoſe of the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, who ſtand for the Laws of God, the Church, and Kingdom. We may have Peace among our ſelves at home, and with our Enemies abroad; and the Church of God may have Peace, and be Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, walking in the fear of the Lord, and the Comfort of the Holy Ghoſt. This ſhall be the Prayer of him, who is one of the meaneſt of the Houſhold of Faith, and deſireth no other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, than to Subſcribe himſelf.</hi>

               <hi>a keeping of a Sabbath.</hi> The reſt that is here properly meant, it is that great Sabbath of reſt that ſhall be kept unto God by all thoſe that depart in the faith, they ſhall keep a perpetual Sabbath unto God, and ſhall for ever ſing. Heavenly Allelujahs unto him, with the Holy Angels in Heaven: But yet in regard this great reſt is ſet forth and expreſſed in the phraſe of a Sabbath keeping, I hope I ſhall not impertinently gather from hence, that all thoſe who look to keep an eternal Sabbath unto God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they ſhould think of this alluſion, and conſider that there remaineth a reſt, a keeping of a Sabbath unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God on Earth, and that none ſhall keep a perpetual ſabbath unto God hereafter, but they who ſanctifie his ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths here. The ſabbath of reſt that is to be kept to God here, as it hath reference to that great ſabbath of reſt hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I may place it in a reſt from ſin. There is none that liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſinneth not, and for men altogether to reſt from ſin here in this world, it is impoſſible: but the Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of wicked men and ſinners that they are tumultuous and raging, that they are like the raging Sea that caſteth up mire
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50882:4"/> and dirt continually: reſtleſs are their imaginations that are<note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 20.</note> unconverted, who give free ſway and ſcope unto themſelves in ſin. The thoughts of their hearts are evil, and that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> they imagine miſchief upon their beds and when it draweth to light, they practiſe it. They have eyes full of<note place="margin">Mich. 2. i. 2 Pet. 2. 14. Job 24. 14. 15. 16.</note> Adultery, that cannot ceaſe to ſin: yea as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh, The eyes of the Adulterer waiteth for the twilight, ſaying, no eye ſhall ſee me, and diſguiſeth his face. The Murtherer ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a theif, in the night they dig thorow houſes which they had marked out for themſelves in the day time: day and night they labour and reſt not from ſinning. This la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour muſt be given over and a ſpiritual reſt embraced.</p>
            <p>Men muſt ſtrive againſt ſin and oppoſe it, and never give over till they have quieted and appeaſed their tumultuous and diſorderly affections, ſo that they have vanquiſhed the ſtrength of ſins the prevailing power of it, ſo that they do not ſuffer any ſin, the leaſt ſin (of which they are convinced in Conſcience that it is ſin) to reign or rule, or bear ſway in their hearts: and if they fall, out of infirmity, (as who is there that liveth and ſinneth not) yet they are grieved for their failings and fallings, riſe again by repentance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ask God forgiveneſs for what they have done amiſs.</p>
            <p>This now is a reſt from ſin, a keeping a perpetual ſabbath unto God; beſide this reſt from ſin, men muſt reſt unto God, have leiſure times to ſerve him: It is the principal end of our Creation, God made us for this end, to ſerve him, and that they ought to ſet apart ſome time for the ſervice of God, this is engraven in the hearts of all men living. For the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate time that God hath appointed for his Worſhip and ſervice, (as for certain he hath after a ſpecial and more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner ſanctified and ſet apart ſome time for that end) we cannot be ſo well guided by the candle of nature, as by the light of the word. The Scriptures then every where, but eſpecially in the fourth Commandement tell us of the reſt of the Holy ſabbath, which the Lord of the ſabbath hath ſevered
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50882:5"/> and ſet apart for his own uſe: one day in ſeven God hath choſe and ſet apart for himſelf. It received its confecration, and was ſet apart to be a day of reſt unto God upon this ground and reaſon, becauſe that God in it reſted from his works of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Church of God in the Apoſtles times, did change the day in memorial of our Saviour his Reſurrection: becauſe that on the firſt day of the week, Chriſt did riſe from the dead and reſted from the great work of our Redemption. Though there be no expreſſe precept in Scripture for the altring of the day, yet that the Apoſtles in their practice, were guided by the ſpirit, it is confeſſed by all Proteſtant writers that are Orthodox: I will alleadge one for all, <hi>Zanchie</hi> after he had related it out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> his Apology to the Emperour <hi>Antoninus,</hi> how the Chriſtians were wont to meet on the Lord's day, to hear the word and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to perform other Holy and Religious exerciſes, he thus concludeth. <hi>Ex his liquet Apoſtolos per ſpiritum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, vel potius ſpiritum Sanctum per Apoſtolos, feſtum ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennitatemque Sabbati, in diem dominicum transtuliſſe:</hi> From this it is manifeſt that the Apoſtles by the ſpirit, or rather the ſpirit of God by the Apoſtles, did transferre the feſtivity and ſolemnity of the ſabbath unto the Lords day: but yet though the day be changed, yet the keeping one day in ſeven by conſecrating it to the ſervice of God, making it a reſt from ſin, and a reſt unto God by, performing in it Holy and Religious exerciſes (which is the morality of the fourth Commandment) is ſtill retained. We are then to keep Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one day in ſeven, not only upon the ground and Reaſon which is laid down in the fourth Commandment, becauſe that in ſix days God finiſhed the works of his Creation, and reſted the ſeventh.</p>
            <p>But we are likewiſe ſtrengthened and confirmed in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Chriſtian Sabbath, which is likewiſe one day in ſeven, in regard that on that day Chriſt did riſe from the dead, and reſt from the great work of our Redemption: So that the morality of the ſabbath is ſo far from being taken away by the change of the day, that it is hereby more ſtrongly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50882:5"/> ſtrengthened and confirmed. That one day in ſeven ſhould be kept Holy is the morality of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: beſide the ſanctifying one day in ſeven, it is requiſite that the ſollemn day for God's ſervice be kept in its ſeaſon, and God requireth not that any 7th. day of our own deviſing ſhould be celebrated, but he looketh and expecteth that ſuch a ſeventh day be kept as he hath appointed. The ſeventh day from the Creation, was the day Commanded of God, and for the time that God required it, this and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to be celebrated. The People of God before the Law, and after the Law given in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> were to keep the ſeventh day from the Creation and no other.</p>
            <p>It may be objected that the Sun, which is the meaſure of time, and of days, it ſtood ſtill in the dayes of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> it went backward in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> ſo that that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſeventh day from the Creation which was firſt celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, could not be punctually obſerved by the people of God under the law.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That ſo long as the people of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, did according to common computation keep the ſeventh day from the Creation, without any willful va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying from God his inſtitution, from the intent and meaning of the law-maker, (who neverrequireth of menimpoſſibilities) they could not be ſaid to be guilty of the breach of the fourth Commandment, though they did not obſerve that numerical identical day from the Creation, which was firſt celebrated. He that made the law may change the Law, and he that made time, in his hand times and ſeaſons are, and he may change them according to his own pleaſure. The ſpirit of God by the Apoſtles did change the ſeventh day from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into that ſeventh day which we now celebrate in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of our Saviour's Reſurrection, and the ſeventh day from the Creation hath forfeited its right, and is become a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon working day, by his appointment in whoſe hands times and ſeaſons are, who changeth them according to his own pleaſure, and now the day ſanctified and ſet apart for God, is our Chriſtian Sabbath, the Lord's day, the firſt day of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50882:6"/> week, this and no other is to be ſanctified, and whoſoever they be that are Chriſtians, acquainted with the Scriptures and the word of God, or the practice of the Church in the Apoſtles times, if they ſet apart any other 7th. day to be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, as the day of God's inſtitution, beſide that which we now celebrate, they make themſelves liable to God's diſpleaſure in this world, and to his eternal indignation in the world to come.</p>
            <p>It may be objected againſt our Chriſtian ſabbath, that that particular ſeventh which the Apoſtles inſtituted by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or rather the ſpirit by the Apoſtles, it hath not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without change to ſome, and it is a queſtion whether it can be continued without change to any: it is obſerved that men in travelling to ſome places of the World, (and ſome Chriſtians have occaſion to Travel for neceſſary traffick) loſe one day in a year: yea Aſtronomers that obſerve the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heavens, and the meaſure of time, do obſerve, that there is continually ſome loſſe, or at leaſt ſome change of time: ſo that that particular ſeventh day that was firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (we ſuppoſing a ſeventh day to be ſet apart) could not ſucceſſively long continue without ſome change or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, Whether they be travellers, or who elſe they be, if they do not willfully tranſgreſſe nor purpoſely vary from God's inſtitution, but according to common computation reckoning time according to the cuſtome of the place where they live, and the perſons with whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, do celebrate the firſt day of the week, the Lord's day, the ſeventh day which the ſpirit of God by the Apoſtles did Command, without chooſing any other ſeventh day of their own heads, (if I ſay) as near as they can they keep themſelves to God's inſtitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they cannot be ſaid to offend againſt the morality of the fourth Commandement, whereby God hath ſet apart a ſeventh day of reſt in memorial of his reſting from the works of his Creation, neither can they be ſaid to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe God's Command by the Apoſtles, whereby he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted this ſeventh day which we now ſanctifie as a day of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50882:6"/> reſt in memorial of our Saviour's reſt from the great work of our Redemption.</p>
            <p>I ſhall illuſtrate this by a plain ſimilitude taken out of Scripture. God Commanded the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to keep<note place="margin">Numb. 9. 10.</note> the paſſeover unto him at a ſet time of the year, upon a ſet day of the month, they were to keep it in the firſt month, upon the fourteenth day of the month: it ſo fell out that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men were defiled by the dead, they inquired of God by <hi>Moſes</hi> whether they were ſo neceſſarily tyed to the day, that they might not keep the paſſover at all, if they did not keep it on the day wherein it was enjoyned to be kept: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was returned, that if any were unclean, or were in a journey a far off then he might alter the time, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the preſcript time for keeping the paſſeover was the 14th. day of the firſt month: the time might be altered and the paſſeover kept on the fourteenth day of the ſecond month, but if a man were clean and not in a journey, and ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to keep the paſſeover at the ſet time appointed, he ſhould be cut off from the people of God, becauſe he brought not the offering of God in his appointed ſeaſon. If neceſſity conſtrain, and men be in a journey travelling, or the change of times be ſuch, that that particular ſeventh day inſtituted, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſucceſſively be continued, or punctually obſerved, God doth not tie men to impoſſibilities, nor yet to great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences; and if men do not willfully tranſgreſs, nor vary from God's inſtitution, but according to common computation, as neer as they can, keep the ſeventh day inſtituted, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they keep God his Sabbaths and obſerve his Ordinances; But if men be not in a journey travelling, and be not hindred from keeping (according to common Computation) the 7th. day inſtituted, and will upon their own heads keep the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh Sabbath, the ſeventh day from the Creation, the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath that is now cancelled, or think it ſufficient to keep any day of their own deviſing, without obſerving of the Lord's day according to the Lord's Ordinance, they exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Communion of Saints, and without ſerious and unſeigned Repentance, make themſelves liable to God's
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50882:7"/> wrath here, to his eternal diſpleaſure hereafter, for not keeping the Lord his Reſt, nor Sanctifying the Sabbath in its appointed ſeaſon. It may be Objected, that the Church of God is ſtill guided by the Spirit, and if the Spirit of God by the Apoſtles did change the Day that was firſt Inſtituted by God; which was the Seventh Day from the Creation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Seventh Day which we now Celebrate: May not the Church of God change it again from this Seventh Day to ſome other? To this I Anſwer, that it cannot be ſuppoſed, that there ſhould be ſuch ground and reaſon for the change of the day as there was in the Apoſtles Time. The cauſe of the change of the Day, it was in memory of our Saviour's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, becauſe that on that Day he reſted from the great work of our Redemption. I ſuppoſe therefore in regard the like Reaſon of a Change cannot be given, the Spirit of God will not again guide the Church to alter the Day. I ſhall propound a Queſtion more profitable, which tendeth more to Edification; and that is, whether God's Conſecrating a Seventh Day to himſelf, and Commanding a weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to be Sanctified; whether this take away the Service of God on Holy days, or on other days of the week? To this I Anſwer; that our weekly Sabbath is ſevered and ſet a part, and after a peculiar manner Sanctified for God's Uſe; but yet we ought to provide for the Service of God in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and meaſure every Day in the week, but eſpecially Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-days and our uſual Feſtivals they ought ſolemnly to be kept, and Religiouſly Obſerved: though there be no day of Divine Inſtitution which God hath expreſly Commanded to be kept Holy but our weekly Sabbath, yet all hold that more time ſhould be allotted to his Service, and the Equity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting Holy-days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſerving God on the week days, of Pray<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note> Dr. <hi>Donn</hi> ſometimes Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> hath delivered his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion agreeable to this, Though God hath taken a ſeventh part of our time in the Sabbath, yet he taketh more too, for he appointeth other Sabbaths, other Feſtivals; and in all Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths there is a ceſſation. To this agreeth <hi>Bucer,</hi> having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Sanctification of the Lords day, he further addeth, it is agreeable to our Piety to ſanctifie other Feſtivals alſo, to the Commemoration of the Lord his chief works, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he perfected our Redemption, as the day of our Saviours Incarnation, Nativity, Epiphany, the Paſſion, Reſurrection, Pentecoſt. Beſides our uſual Feſtivals and ſolemn dayes of Rejoycing, (which though they be appointed by men, yet the Equity of conſtituting them is grounded on the Fourth Commandement,) no reaſonable man nor good Chriſtian will deny, but ſome time may, but ſome time ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed every day in the Week for the Service of God. In Towns and Cities where People may conveniently meet, that they ought to reſort to the Temple and the Houſe of God, to offer unto him their Morning and their Evening Sacrifice, and worſhip him in the Beauty of Holineſs, this is a thing ſo juſt and reaſonable, that I hope I need not tell thoſe who
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50882:8"/> doe this, that they do but their Duties; for their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll tell thoſe who live in places where they may doe it, that they ought to pray publiquely every day in the week, and attend upon God's ſervice continually. We are not ſo happy in Countrey Villages, that we ſhould meet publickly every day in the week to worſhip God in the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Holineſs. And for People that live in unwalled Towns and Countrey Villages, if they keep the Church duely on Sundayes and Holydayes, Week-dayes Prayers are required of them but at ſome times in the year, and when they are required, it is not required that they ſhould pray every day in the week: It is truth, Maſters of Families ſhould be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Houſhold-piety, and there are none but they ſhould pray in their own perſons continually: ſuch a Sabbath of Reſt ſhould be ſanctified to God continually, and it is grounded on the Morality of the Fourth Commandement. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in the words of Mr. <hi>Greenham,</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Sabbath, though no day ought to be ſeparated from God's uſe, the Sabbath ought to be ſevered from all other uſes, and wholly conſecrated to him. Men ought to keep their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Prayer, and pray privately every day in the week in their Houſes, and with their Families; and men ought publickly to attend upon God in his Houſe, and privately be at leiſure for holy Exerciſes on Holy dayes. All Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes are not, but if ſome be ſo ſevered for holy Exerciſes that they are as carefully kept, and as religiouſly obſerved to the worlds eye, as our Chriſtian Sabbath; yet if men, through heedleſneſs and inadvertency do ſome ſlight works of their Callings in them, and do not thoſe things purpoſely in contempt of Authority, for certain this is not ſo hainous a ſin, that men need to task themſelves with a dayes or a weeks Repentance for it; and if men be at leiſure for holy and religious Exerciſes on Holy-dayes, no doubt but on theſe dayes they may be at leiſure for themſelves, and have ſome time to recreate and refreſh themſelves on Holy-dayes, eſpecially thoſe of the meaner ſort who have no other times of Recreation. Holy-dayes, they are not ſo ſevered for holy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50882:8"/> and religious Exerciſes, but ſome works may be done in them, if they be not done in contempt o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Authority; and at fitting and convenient times lawfull Sports and Paſtimes may lawfully be uſed in them, eſpecially by thoſe of the meaner ſort. Other working dayes, they are not exempted from God's Service, we are bound to ſerve God in them, and to pray unto him, but yet theſe are Our dayes, God hath given them us to follow our neceſſary Occaſions and worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; No day that may properly be termed God's day, but the ſeventh day, of his Conſecration, our weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, this is the day which God after a peculiar manner hath ſanctified, and he requireth that we after a ſpecial and more peculiar manner ſhould obſerve it and keep it Holy. Reſt from Labour, from worldly buſineſſes and Employments is required on the Sabbath; Men muſt not follow the works of their calling, but muſt as neer as they can abſtain from all corporal labour. They muſt likewiſe reſt from ſin, as on all dayes, ſo more eſpecially on Gods Holy day; they muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from following their own wayes, from finding their own pleaſure, and from ſpeaking their own words. They muſt likewiſe work the works of Righteouſneſs, and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully employed in holy and religious Exerciſes. Neceſſary works there be which may lawfully be done on the Lords day; ſuch things as concern mens neceſſary Nouriſhment may be done; and no doubt but men may provide for the dumb Beaſts on the Sabbath, and looſe the Oxe and the Aſſe from the Stall to be watered, yea ſome perſons are privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to do the works of their Calling on the Lords day. Our Saviour telleth us, how that on the Sabbath day, the<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 5.</note> Prieſts in the Temple profane the Sabbath and are blameleſs. And no doubt but the Miniſters of the Goſpel may do the works of their Calling on the Lords day, yea, if they beat their brains, and buſie their bodies; the more carefully they are employed in the works of their Calling on the Lords day, the more acceptable Service they perform to God. It is a thing exceeding painfull to thoſe who ſtudy for their Sermons, to perform their Miniſterial Function in inſtructing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50882:9"/> the people. Their Mind doth labour, and they are greatly b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſied on ſuch Lords dayes as they do preach unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; beſides, it is a wearineſs to their Bodies to read Prayers, to adminiſter the Sacraments to multitudes, and to do other Duties belonging to their Place and Callings: But yet working on the Lords day, is a Duty belonging to their Place and Callings, and an acceptable Service it is to God, if it be performed carefully and conſcionably as it ought. Beſides works of Neceſſity there are works of Charity, which all men (but eſpecially thoſe that are of Ability) ought to perform. The Viſiting the ſick, the relieving of the Poor, and doing Offices of Charity for thoſe that are in diſtreſs. It was uſual with the Primitive Chriſtians on every Lords day to make Collections, and do Offices of Charity. Phyſicians (no doubt) may ride and take Journeys on the Lords day, temper Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and adminiſter Phyſick to the Diſeaſed. Beſide works of Charity, which have ever been in uſe, and may lawfully and laudably be done, works of Piety are proper for the day, I purpoſe more particularly to inſiſt upon theſe, and ſhew how the Sabbath ought to be conſecrated to ſuch works, and be ſpent in holy and religious Exerciſes, ſo that men ſhould be at leiſure for God on that day. It is a Day greatly to be obſerved unto the Lord, and men ſhould think of it before it cometh, there is a <hi>Memento</hi> prefixed before this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Remember the Sabbath to keep it holy;</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> calleth the day before the Sabbath the Preparation, <hi>Mar. 15. ver.</hi> 42. becauſe it was uſual with the People of God to prepare themſelves for the Sanctification of the Sabbath, (as it is the Duty of all good Chriſtians) on that day they ſhould lay aſide all earthly Cogitations and worldly Buſineſſes, and ſeparate themſelves to the ſervice of the Lord, and perform all ſuch holy and religious Exerciſes as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on the day. As on all dayes men ought to pray in their own Perſons, and with their Families, ſo more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the Lords day they ought to ſanctifie themſelves, and prepare their Families for the Sanctification of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and for performance of ſuch holy and religious Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50882:9"/> as are required in God's Houſe, as likewiſe for ſuch Duties as are required to be performed in their own Houſes. I ſhall briefly run over the publick Performances, the holy and religious Exerciſes that are required in God's Houſe; and then likewiſe touch upon thoſe that are required in every mans own houſe. Men ſhould with fear and reverence aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves in the Houſe of God, the Place where his Honour dwelleth, there after a ſpecial and more peculiar manner to worſhip him on the Lords day.</p>
            <p>The firſt and ſpecial publick Duty required, and of greateſt concernment for the Sanctification of the Sabbath, is the <hi>Praying unto God in the Houſe of Prayer,</hi> the pouring out Supplications to him, the offering up to him every Sabbath day a Morning and an Evening Sacrifice, worſhipping him in the Beauty of Holineſs with the Congregation of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; this is a Duty which cannot be omitted, and that of all other Duties it is moſt eſpecially required for the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Sabbath, I think I ſhall eaſily prove. In the 56<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the Prophecy of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, ver.</hi> 2. the Prophet ſetteth it forth, That <hi>bleſſed is the Man that doth this, and the Son of Man that layeth hold of it, that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it.</hi> I, but you will ſay, How ſhall we keep the Sabbath from polluting it? and what is a ſpecial Means to ſanctifie it? If you read that Chapter, and conſider ſeriouſly of the Bleſſedneſs which God bath pronounced upon thoſe that keep his Sabbaths, you muſt needs ſee that a principal means of ſanctifying his Sabbath, whereby to procure the like bleſſing upon your ſelves, is to pray unto God in his Houſe, upon his Holy Day: in <hi>verſ. 4. Thus ſaith the Lord of the Eunuches that keep my Sabbaths, and chooſe the things that pleaſe me, and lay hold of my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, even to them will I give in mine Houſe, and within my walls, a place and a Name better than of Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; I will give them an everlaſting Name which ſhall not be cut off. Alſo the Sons of the Strangers that joyn themſelves to the Lord, to ſerve him, and to love the Name of the Lord, to be his ſervants, every one that keepeth the Sabbath from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50882:10"/> polluting it, and taketh hold of my Covenant; even them will I bring to my holy Mountain, and make them joyfull in my Houſe of Prayer: Their Burnt-offerings and their Sacrifices ſhall be accepted upon mine Altar: For mine Houſe ſhall be called a Houſe of Pray<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r to all People.</hi> When God by the Prophet ſpeaketh of his accepting the Burnt-offerings of the Strangers of the Eunuchs, the words are meant of the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to him the calves of their Lips, theſe are the Offerings that he will accept, no doubt but the words are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Sacrifice of Prayſe, of the Oblations of Prayer, as is manifeſtly proved by that which immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; <hi>Mine houſe ſhall be called an houſe of Prayer to all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> Yea, he that ſeeth not that the principal Means of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God's Sabbath is to pray unto God in his Houſe of Prayer, he muſt needs be a ſtranger to the Scriptures, and the Word of God. If then you will indeed ſanctifie God's Sabbath by performing in it holy and religious Exerciſes, be perſwaded to tread his Courts, and be preſent continually at Divine Service: Slight not Divine Service, and ſay not, (as it is the common cuſtom of moſt men in theſe times) If we goe up to Gods Houſe we ſhall hear there onely a few Prayers; but ſay rather on the contrary, If we go up to Gods Houſe, we ſhall there ſay our Prayers with the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faithfull, worſhip God in the Beauty of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is a principal Means of ſanctifying Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and a Duty which of all others God will moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially reward.</p>
            <p>The Word of God it ſhould be publickly read on the Lords-day; this is a holy and religious Exerciſe that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the day, and ſo neceſſary for the Sanctification of the Sabbath, that it cannot be omitted. It was uſual to read ſomething out of Holy Writ to the People every Sabbath day, as you may ſee by that which is alleadged by St. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13. 27. Where he ſetteth it forth, that the Rulers of the <hi>Jews</hi> condemned our Saviour becauſe they knew not the voyces of the Prophets which were read every Sabbath day; By this place of Scripture it is plain, that it was in uſe to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50882:10"/> read ſomething out of the Law and the Prophets every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day. This Cuſtom it hath been ſolemnly kept and religiouſly obſerved by the Chriſtan Churches and reading of the Scriptures as it is a Religious Exerciſe proper for the Day, and neceſſary for the ſanctification of the Sabbath, ſo it is of great uſe, and tendeth much to Edification. Our Church hath wiſely appointed and religiouſly conſtituted, that ſome of the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> ſhould be read every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day: There be likewiſe Leſſons appointed to be read every Lords-day, two at Morning and two at Evening Prayer, one out of the Old, another out of the New Teſtament: Epiſtles and Goſpels are appointed to be read on every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath thoroughout the year: Where there is no Preacher, or when the Miniſter is not prepared to Preach, there be godly Homilies and fruitfull Exhortations appointed to be read unto the People: If then you deſire to ſanctifie the Sabbath, by performing in it holy and rel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gious Exerciſes, you ſhall do well to attend to the Word of God publickly read, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ſhall gain Knowledge in the Scriptures, and be fitted and prepared to receive the engra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted VVord of God which is able to ſave your ſouls: Yea, the Reading of Homilies is a kind of Preaching, and if it be carefully and conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably uſed, no doubt but it may be as effectual (peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more effectua) for the Converſion of Souls, than moſt Sermons that are preached in theſe times. Think then of this holy and religious Exerciſe, how proper it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s for the day, how neceſſary for the ſanctification of the Sabbath, and let no Lords day paſs without coming up to the Temple, to hear the Word of God publickly read unto you. The Word of God publickly preached, expounded unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by thoſe that are ſet apart for that Office and Function. It is the uſual, the ordinary Means of Salvation; and when it is deſpiſed and contemned, God will not work without it. It is then a Religious Exerciſe of great uſe, and of all other dayes the Sabbath is moſt proper for it: Yet this I muſt ſay, (for I conceive it is the truth) though the Sabbath be moſt proper for this Exerciſe, yet this Exerciſe is neither ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50882:11"/> proper nor ſo neceſſary for the Sabbath, that it ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the Sabbath ſhould be ſanctified without it: This I ſhall eaſily evince out of the Scriptures; in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 15. we read, how that after the reading of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Rulers of the Synagogue ſent unto <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bas,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Men and Brethren, if you have any Word of Exhortation to ſay unto the People, ſay on,</hi> If it had been a cuſtome of the Church to have Preaching in every Synagogue on every Sabbath day, no doubt but the Reader that read there had been prepared to preach: Neither would the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Synagogue have deſired the Apoſtles, if they had any word of Exhortation to preach, but rather would have ſaid, You are Miniſters, and Men of God, alwayes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Preach, and therefore there is no doubt to be made, but you have a Sermon and an Exhortation in readineſs. Though then it may be collected from hence, that theſe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were willing to accept of a Sermon when they did meet with ſuch Miniſters as were prepared to preach, yet for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, their queſtioning with the Apoſtles whether they were prepared, did ſhew that they did not hold Preaching ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the Sabbath could not be ſanctified without it. Where the Word of God may be had by one or more able Miniſters, that the Word of God may he preached twice every Sabbath, thrice every Sabbath (if the Cuſtom of the place be to have ſo many Sermons) this I will not deny. But that there muſt be Preaching every Sabbath day, in every Congregation, this I think it cannot be proved. Some Miniſters have made the world believe, that the Sabbath in no place can be ſanctified without preaching of Sermons, and have wrought people to ſuch an eſteem of Sermons, that all other of God's Ordinances are diſeſteemed, ſo that no other holy and religious Exerciſes can find any place in the places where they are admitted, but onely Sermons: Yea they have turned <hi>Oratoria</hi> into <hi>Auditoria,</hi> Houſes of Prayer into Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Preaching, and in all places where they have come, have brought all holy and religious Exerciſes on the Lords day out of uſe, but onely a Pſalm and a Sermon. God did
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50882:11"/> never yet ſend ſuch plenty of Labourers into his Harveſt; that there ſhould be ſuch ſtore of able and painful Preachers, that Sermons ſhould be Preached every Sabbath day in every Congregation. For my part, I will pray unto the Lord of the Harveſt, that he would ſend Labourers into his Harveſt, &amp; could heartily wiſh, that all the Miniſters belonging to every Congregation in the Kingdom were indeed Prophets, that they could Preach every Sabbath day, or would Preach painfully, and Conſcionably, though they Preached ſeldomer. But this, I ſay, it is impoſſible that the Kingdom at this time ſhould be thus Happy: And ſome Miniſters by buzzing in the ears of People, that Preaching of the Word in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, on every Sabbath-day is neceſſarily required by the Word of God, have made the whole Kingdom miſerable: yea, they have brought the Ordinance of God into contempt by their idle babling, and lazy pratling, who Talk much and often, but Preach ſeldom.</p>
            <p>But I beſeech you, beloved, let not the abuſe of God's Ordinance by ſome, cauſe you to neglect the Lawful Uſe of it: For Preaching, it is the Power of God unto Salvation; a Sabbath-days Exerciſe, which of all others is of greateſt Uſe for the Converſion of Souls, for the bringing Men from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light; from Blindneſs and Ignorance, to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. Be perſwaded then, hear the Word of God every Sabbath-day when it is publickly Preached, and never miſs the Sermons; love thoſe Miniſters that Preach Painfully and Conſcionably; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not thoſe who Preach often, and plead earneſtly for Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, though you know, and are aſſured, that ſome of them are but lazy Preachers, leſt haply you be found deſpiſers, and contemners of the Ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>There are other Holy and Religious Exerciſes which are required on the Sabbath-day: Catechiſing the Youth, and the Inſtructing them in the Principles of Religion; if it be not neceſſary on every Sabbath-day, yet it is on ſome Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days very ſeaſonable; and People ſhould at ſeaſonable times on ſome Sabbath-days, ſend their Servants and their Children
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50882:12"/> to be Inſtructed in the Principles of Religion, and to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſed.</p>
            <p>The Receiving of the Sacraments are Holy and Religious Exerciſes, to be performed (if poſſibly it may be) on the Lords day. It was uſual with the Primitive Chriſtians on every Lords day to eat of that Heavenly and Soul-refreſhing <hi>Manna,</hi> the Body and Blood of our bleſſed Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt. And hereupon was that uſual and Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpeech amongſt them, <hi>Celebraſti Dominicum, ſumpſiſti Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum;</hi> thou didſt keep the Lords day, thou didſt feed on thy Lord and Saviour, eat his Body, and drink his Blood. It is not in uſe with us on every Lords day to Celebrate the Lords Supper, yet this is a Duty often to be performed, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth it forth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> firſt Epiſtle, <hi>11th.</hi> Chapter, and we ſhould as often as conveniently we can, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Lords Day, by Receiving in it the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>The other Sacrament of Baptiſm, it ſhould likewiſe (if with conveniency it may) be Adminiſtred on the Lords day, for the Sanctifying the Sabbath, by performing in it this Holy and Religious Exerciſe, for it is a means to put People in mind of the Vows and Promiſes that they themſelves did make to God in Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>I have been ſomething longer than I made Account, in Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Publique Religious performances that ſhould be performed in Gods Houſe. I ſhall but touch upon thoſe that ſhould be performed in every Mans own Houſe.</p>
            <p>Private Meditation upon the Word of God, whether Read or Preached; this is a Duty that careful Chriſtians ought Conſcionably to perform in their own Houſes. When they are Retired to their Houſes, and are private by themſelves, they ſhould digeſt by Meditation the good Word of God; Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it up in their Hearts, to bring forth the Fruit of it in their Lives and Converſations. If they come into Company, and have Occaſion to Diſcourſe with any, whether in their own Houſes, or with others in theirs: They ſhould endeavour to break off all Diſcourſe of Earthly Affairs, and Worldly buſineſſe, and ſhould Reaſon of the Scriptures, of things
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50882:12"/> concerning their Salvation: On the Lords day eſpecially they ſhould think of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Exhortation to the <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſians,</hi> Chap. 4. ver. 29. <hi>And let no Corrupt Communication proceed out of their Mouths, but ſuch as is good, to the uſe of Edifying, that it may miniſter Grace to the Hearers.</hi> At leiſure times they ſhould Catechiſe and Inſtruct their Children on the Lords day, Read in their Families the Word of God; talk of it when they ſit in their Houſes, and walk before their Families in the ways of God's Commandments. When they have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all theſe Duties, they ſhould ſhut up the Sabbath with Prayers and Supplications, and as near as they can, ſpend the whole day in Holy and Religious Exerciſes. If we did our Duties as we ought, we ſhould indeed ſo Sanctifie God's Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that in it we ſhould neither think our own thoughts, nor ſpeak our own words, nor do our own works. But the beſt fall ſhort of their Duties, and do not Sanctifie God's Sabbath according as he requireth; they may hope to be ſo happy in Heaven, but they can never be ſo Holy on Earth; yea, the good God will pardon thoſe that ſet their hearts to ſeek, and to ſerve him, though their failings and fallings are great and many, not onely on week days, but on the Lords day; yea, he is an indulgent Father: And ſuch things as are reputed by ſome to be great ſins, as the Carriage of Beds, and the bearing of Burdens, and the ſelling Wares, in thoſe of the meaner ſort, he will look upon them as no ſins, or as very ſmall Infirmities. If men fall out of Infirmity, and are grieved for theſe things, and are wary, and watchful over themſelves how they fall into thoſe ſins for time to come; Or elſe do theſe things at the Command of their Governours and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, who they know would not Command them ſuch things if they did not know that they were ſuch works of Neceſſity as may be done on any Sabbath-day, or ſuch works of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as muſt be done on that Sabbath-day as they Command them. And he will not ſee concerning ſome that are Perſons of Quality and Faſhion, Miniſters and Magiſtrates, that they are not frequent in performance of Holy and Religious Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: And if they be drawn in to Feaſt and Banquet on the Lords
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50882:13"/> day, and do Prophane the Sabbath by fooliſh talking, and vain jeſting; yet if they Repent of their failings, of their fallings, and do not wilfully prophane the Sabbath themſelves, nor nouriſh others in the contempt of Holy and Religious Exerciſes; he will pardon and forgive thoſe ſins, for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth of the Temptations that ſome have to ſin, of the pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs and hinderances that they have to Piety. And again, he is very ſtrict and preciſe, a ſevere Judge, and will ſee in ſome of the meaner ſort ſuch things as ſeem to the Worlds eye to be very ſmall Infirmities; the gathering of ſticks, and playing in the ſtreets, and note them as hainous ſins; yea, he will not ſee that thoſe that do thoſe things keep the Church duly, and are frequent in Religious Exerciſes; if they do theſe things out of Hypocriſie, to bear themſelves out in their preſumptuous wickedneſs. And he will note ſome that are Perſons of Quality and Faſhion, how they prophane the Sabbath by idle Diſcourſe and vain talking, and will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it in them that they are frequent and often in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Religious Exerciſes. If they make Religion a Cloak for their Malice, and will not Repent of this ſin, but are obſtinate to have all Men as frequent and often in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Holy and Religious Exerciſes as themſelves; for he conſidereth of the Opportunities that ſome have to do good, of the helps and encouragements that they have to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Yea, the Merciful God hath a care of the dumb Beaſts, and one of the Reaſons why he hath Ordained a Sabbath, is, that they ſhould reſt every ſeventh day, and not be over-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed with working. And much more hath he a care of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures; he hath Ordained a Sabbath of Reſt, not meerly out of reſpect to himſelf, that he ſhould be Served, and his Sabbath Sanctified by performing in them Holy and Religious Exerciſes, but he hath a reſpect to Servants and Day Labourers, and hath Ordained a ſeventh day of Reſt, that Servants and Day-Labourers might have ſome time to reſt from Labour as well as their Maſters. So it is ſet forth in the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>Deut. 14 ver.</hi> the latter part of the verſe, one of the Reaſons why God hath Commanded a Sabbath of Reſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50882:13"/> to be kept Holy, is, that the Man-Servant and the Maid-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant may Reſt as well as thou. If thou beeſt a Maſter of a Family, thou mayſt when thou wilt Reſt from Labour: God hath appointed a time when the Man-Servant and the Maid-Servant may do this as well as thy ſelf, and that is upon his Sabbath of Reſt: Now, thy Man-Servant and thy Maid-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant may Reſt as well as thou; yea, thou art bound in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Conſcience to favour thy Servants, and after a ſpecial manner give them Reſt on the Lords day. Not that Servants or Labourers are exempted from Sanctifying God's Sabbaths, by performing in them Holy and Religious Exerciſes: But this I ſay, if they keep the Church duly, and ſhew no diſtaſte or diſlike of Houſhold Piety, but are willing to hear the Word read, and to Pray with their Maſters on the Lords day when they are required; They ſhould in Mercy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to them, give them ſome time wherein they may reſt from Labour, and have a Relaxation from Spiritual and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Duties. <hi>The Spirit truly is willing, but the Fleſh is weak,</hi> and Maſters of Families cannot ſo Sanctifie God's Sabbath, that they ſhould ſpend it wholly in Religious Exerciſes; and therefore they ſhould not wonder at their Servants, if they be willing on the Sabbath-day to have ſome time, wherein they may Reſt from Labour, and have a Relaxation from Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Divine Duties. Yea, the wiſdom of Governours, conſidering the impoſſibility that all the world ſhould be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted to Holy and Religious Exerciſes on the Lords day, did think fitting to permit Day-Labourers, Men-ſervants, and Maid-ſervants to recreate themſelves at ſeaſonable times on the Lords day, leſt while they Reſted from Labour, and were vacant from Spiritual and Divine Duties, they ſhould run out into Riot and Exceſs, or into ſome worſe ſins.</p>
            <p>This Toleration of ſports and paſtimes on the Lords day, did no more diſprove the Morality of the Sabbath, nor no more prove ſports and paſtimes on the Lords day to be Lawful, than the Statute that ſtinteth Uſury at a certain ſumme in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, proveth Uſury to be Lawful by the Word of God: Whereas the Statute is expreſs, that no Man ſhould Collect
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50882:14"/> from that Statute, that that Uſury, or any Uſury was Law-Lawful in Religion and Conſcience.</p>
            <p>But it hath been Objected heretofore by ſome, and it may be will be Objected again, That there was never any Law made heretofore for the toleration of Sports and Paſtimes on the Lords day. Becauſe there is an Act of Parliament that doth expreſly forbid that no Perſons ſhould go out of their own Pariſh to uſe any ſports and paſtimes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer, that it was uſual in times of Popery, of blindneſs, and of Ignorance, Many Pariſhes did meet at one Pariſh to Celebrate <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Feaſts, and to have tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Aſſemblies, Drunken Wakes, and Diſordered Meetings. And the wiſdom of Governours did prudently provide againſt this miſchief. But it may be probably Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and reaſonably Concluded, that the Honourable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, the High Court of Parliament, by prohibiting Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to go out of their own Pariſhes to uſe ſports and paſtimes on the Lords day, did tacitely yield, that if they did keep themſelves within their own Pariſhes, they might<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble times uſe ſuch ſports and paſtimes on the Lords day as were judged Lawful on other days. But if the Honourable Aſſembly, the High Court of Parliament, ſhall Declare that this is not the meaning of that Act, and ſhall hereafter with the conſent of his Sacred Majeſty, make an Act againſt Peoples uſing all ſports and paſtimes whatſoever, as well in their own Pariſhes, as out of them: It becometh me and all peaceable Sons of the Church, to judge, That no body ought to tolerate themſelves, or to countenance or encourage others in the uſe of any ſports and paſtimes on the Lords day, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their own Pariſhes, or out of them. But yet this I ſay, the Holy Man <hi>Job,</hi> in the Profeſſion of his Innocency, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 13. layeth it down, <hi>How he did not deſpiſe the Cauſe of his Man-Servant, or of his Maid-Servant when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with him:</hi> And Maſters of Families, while they look to reſtrain their Servants from uſing ſports and Paſtimes on the Lords day, they ſhould take heed how they conſtrain them to work. It is uſual with ſome Maſters of Families, who ſeem
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50882:14"/> to be very Pious, very watchful over their Servants, that they uſe no ſports and paſtimes on the Lords day, they very frequently conſtrain them to work on the Lords day: Set them to mend, yea, to make Hedges, no neceſſity conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Yea, many times they ſet them to Brew, and do Actions as painful and laborious as any are done on the week days. Maſters of Families if they do Obſerve in their Servants a care of Religion and Piety, that they are willing to be preſent at Divine Duties, Publickly at Gods Houſe, Privately in their Houſes; they ſhould be compaſſionate towards them, allow them ſome times to refreſh themſelves, to reſt from Labour on the Lords day: Yea, they ſhould be thus Merciful to the dumb Beaſts, for God many times heareth the groans of their Ox and their Aſſe, and much more will he hear the Cry of their Servants, when they cry againſt them: They ſhould be more Compaſſionate to them; in the bowels of Compaſſion they ſhould look upon their Servants, and eſteem of them as their Fellow-Servants in Chriſt Jeſus; and think that God hath made them Lords, not Tyrants over them, to cauſe them to drudge and droyl without any Intermiſſion.</p>
            <p>Beſides times of Reſt on the Lords day, which they ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are bound to allow their Servants, they ſhould think of it, and allow them ſometimes to recreate themſelves: The Church hath Conſtituted Holy-days, and though they ought principally to be kept, by performing in them Holy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Exerciſes, yet without doubt ſports and paſtimes at ſeaſonable times may be uſed on theſe days: And Merciful Maſters, if their Servants keep the Church duly, and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at publique Prayers on Holy-days, they ſhould allow them Liberty to Recreate themſelves on theſe days, to uſe ſports and paſtimes. None of us can Sanctifie a Sabbath of Reſt as we ſhould in this World; we ſhould Serve God on week days, on Holy-days, but eſpecially on the Lords day; we have many failings and fallings, and fall ſhort of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Let us bear with one anothers Infirmities, and the good God ſhall pardon all our Infirmities, and accept of our weak and imperfect Serving him.</p>

               <p>I Have ſpoken of a Sabbath of Reſt, and indeed we ſhould all the days of our Life keep a Sabbath unto God: We ſhould Reſt from ſin, pray unto him always, and be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devout: But the day that he hath Sanctified and ſet apart for his Worſhip and Service, we ſhould above all days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that, after a peculiar manner Sanctifie it, and ſpend it in Holy and Religious Exerciſes. This is the King, the Queen of Days, and of all other days ought to be had in chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eſtimation. It is a great Errour of the Papiſts, when they cauſe the Maid to Exalt her ſelf above the Miſtreſs, the Hand-Maid to Rule over the Queen, and ſuffer every petty Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to juſtle the Lords day out of Doors. Yea, it was uſual with us in times of Blindneſs and Ignorance: Many Pariſhes did Meet in one Pariſh to Celebrate <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Feaſts; yea, they did bring their May-Lady into the Church in time of Divine Service, and did take off the minds of People from Religion and the Service of God, cauſing the Lords day to be Celebrated with more Fooliſh vanities than ever the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens Celebrated the Feaſts of their Belly-god <hi>Bacchus,</hi> or their Laſcivious Lady <hi>Venus.</hi> Theſe Times of Ignorance God winked at, but now he Commandeth all Men every where to Repent: Yea, be perſwaded to Conſider of it, and take heed of all back-ſliding to Popery. It is uſual now in ſuch places where the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion Ruleth and beareth ſway, the Lords day is Celebrated with little Piety in God's Houſe, and with more prophaneneſs out of it. And yet I beſeech you, ſuffer the word of Exhortation, let us not ſo Oppoſe Papiſm, that we ſhould run into the contrary extreme of Atheiſm. The Papiſts they do ſo ſlight the Lords day, that they prefer every Ordinary Holy-day before it. And we (or at the leaſt, the greateſt part of us) do ſo highly magnifie the Lords day, that we have thruſt all other holy days out of the Kalendar. We ſhould Serve God on week days, Come up to his Temple too
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50882:15"/> to ſerve him, and to Pray unto him on Holy-days: There be other Sabbaths beſides the Seventh day of Gods Inſtitut on, and God requireth, not onely that we hear the Inſtruction of him our Heavenly Father, and keep Holy his Sabbath, the Seventh day, which he hath expreſſly Commanded to be San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified: But he requireth that we forſake not the Laws and Conſtitutions that the Church our Mother giveth us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sanctifying of Holy-days, for theſe likewiſe are God's Sabbaths, though Conſtituted by the Church; and God requireth that we keep his Sabbaths, and Reverence his Sanctuary. We ſhould ſerve God on week days, come up to his Houſe, and ſerve him on Holy-days, and after a ſpecial manner Sanctifie the Seventh day of his Conſecration: But we on the contrary have polluted God's Sabbaths, propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Sanctuary, and notwithſtanding the noiſe that is made of Holy and Religious Exerciſes on the Lords day, the Lords day was never leſs hallowed. Shall I ſhew you how it was of late days, when there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but every body did that was right in their own eyes. Publick Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wherein People might joyn with the Prieſt, on the Lords day, where they were uſed, they were very much ſcorned and contemned, and in moſt places quite given over. And on week days, and on Holy-days not permitted at all to be uſed.</p>
               <p>The Word of God where it was publickly read was very much ſlighted, and in many places not read at all. So that People for want of having the Scriptures and the Word of God read unto them, were kept in more blindneſs and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance than they are in the Papacy.</p>
               <p>Publick Catechiſing of the Youth at ſeaſonable times, and the reading of Homilies, for the Inſtructing of People in the Principles of Religion, they were deſpiſed as things unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and of no uſe at all.</p>
               <p>The Sacrament of the Lords Supper in many places, and moſt Churches it was not publickly Adminiſtred for many Years together.</p>
               <p>The Sacrament of Baptiſm a prejudice was wrought againſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50882:16"/> it, and People were made to believe, that they ought not to Baptize their Children, or bring them within the Covenant. Since it hath pleaſed God to reſtore us to Government, and the Bleſſings of it, the ſame deſign (as it is greatly to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is ſtill under-hand carryed on, and ſome that ſeem to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and be Obedient to the preſent Government, under a pretence of their love to Piety, and their Care of en to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Holy and Religious Exerciſes, ſeek to make themſelves and their followers Independent, that is, not ſubject to any Temporal Magiſtrate, or Eccleſiaſtical Governour. We will be ſo Charitable, as to believe, that they did heretofore often Fall and Pray and perform other Holy and Religious Exerciſes themſelves in private, And receive the Sacrament in publick with their own Companies. But they did bereave the World of the uſe of all God's Ordinances in publick but Pſalm and a Sermon. And no doubt of it, but divers of them do now pray in private, read the Word of God in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Catechiſe and Inſtruct their Children and perform other Holy &amp; Religious Exerciſes very frequently in private, and I cannot believe that any vertuous Religious Governour, either in Church or Common-wealth, meaneth to trouble them for, or diſturb them in theſe things. If thoſe of the Clergy among them will ſay, the publick Prayers of the Church, after that manner that they are enjoyned to ſay them, and will read the Scriptures in publick, and the Homilies of the Church, ſo as to work people to a love of them, and of the good Inſtructions therein contained, and not read them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner, as to cauſe them to be ſcorned of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and not neglect publick Catechiſing, but perform it according as it is enjoyned to be performed.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50882:16"/> contempt upon all publick Religious Duties that are enjoyned by Authority (except Sermons) as things that have all things of Man, and nothing of God in them: They that are Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous amongſt them, ſhall not be diſcountenanced by Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, or any Body elſe for their Piety and Godlineſs. Of thoſe who have been heretofore, and are ſtill oppoſite to the preſent Government, and labour to work others to be of their mind and Opinion. Many are Ignorant Perſons, and as they have no will to pray in publick, ſo they have no skill to pray in private, and are taken in onely to bear up the Train of the Faction. Others of them (whatſoever others Report of them, or they Report of themſelves) they are wicked, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, ungodly Perſons, their ſins apparent and conſpicuous, obvious to every Eye; and though their abſenting themſelves from, and their ſlighting of publick Religious performances, cauſeth them to be noted of the Faction to be Saints; yet their private Religious performances are neither ſo frequent, nor ſo fervent that any ſhould take notice of them but themſelves, and thoſe of their own Faction. Some well meaning Men there be among them, both of the Clergy and the Laity, who love and practiſe Holy and Religious Exerciſes in private, and are not, nor would not be any great Enemies to them in publick: But that the Grandees of Faction work upon them, and make them believe that the publick Religious Duties required by the Laws, (becauſe enjoyned) have more of Man in them than of God, and are therefore Superſtitious and unlawful to be done. To ſay the Truth (though all of them do not often perform Holy and Religious Exerciſes, and others of them are ſo Ignorant, that they cannot at all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them) divers of them they were heretofore, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

If Men Faſt and Pray never ſo often, if they do it for bad ends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wicked purpoſes. Theſe their Religious Actions are turned into ſin unto them. And if Man
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50882:17"/> be never ſo frequent in performance of Holy and Religious Exerciſes in publick, in private. If they do theſe things that they may ſubvert the preſent Government, and make Peoples hearts diſ-affected to it: All their Religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, though never ſo ſpecious in the Eyes of Men, are yet abominable in the Eyes of God: Yea, ſuch Perſons who uſe Holy and Religious Exerciſes out of Policy, not out of true Piety, looking thereby to bring about their evil and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſigns, They have cauſed Religion and Religious Duties to be loathed and hated, ſo that Mens hearts turn againſt the uſe of God's Ordinances: Indeed it ſhould not be ſo, Man ſhould not therefore abſtain from, but they ſhould therefore often uſe God's Ordinances themſelves in Truth, becauſe they are ſo often abuſed by others in Hypocriſie: And for certain it muſt be ſuch who honour God in his Ordinances, and often uſe them that muſt keep Hypocrites from abuſing them; defeat and bring to light their Treacherous practices, and their Treaſonous deſigns, whereby they ſeek to undo both Church and Common-wealth. A great many of prophane and ungodly perſons and people there are, who are wicked without ſhew of the contrary, who as they do often meet on week-days at Inns, Taverns, and Ale-Houſes, and ſpend their time in Rioting and Drunkenneſs, Swearing and Curſing, and prophaning God's Holy Name, to the diſhonour of Religion, and diſcredit of the Goſpel of Chriſt. So many times they have their riotous meetings at the ſame places on the Lords day, ſometimes in the time of Divine Service, to the grief of all good Men, and to the ſcandal and Offence of all Godly Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Indeed they ſeem oppoſite enough to Hypocriſie, and very willing and deſirous they are that they ſhould be Reformed, who cloak Treaſon under the ſhew of Religion. But Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and thoſe that are in Authority, hold it fitting that they ſhould firſt Reform their own Lives, and ſet a better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Holineſs, before they ſeek the Reformation of others: Yea, it is plain, that moſt of ſuch diſſolute and diſordered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they do (for the moſt part) rather rail and revile Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50882:17"/> for being Religious, than uſe any Legal or Lawful means; whereby to reduce them from their Hypocriſie; yea, though fome ſtayd, ſober, vertuous Perſons, whom Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity forceth into their Company, do Legally and Lawfully Oppoſe Hypocriſie, and Labour to prevent the ſpreading Contagion of it, and they by their Example learn to do the like; and have been wrought and perſwaded to be willing to jeopard their Lives againſt thoſe who put the Face of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Rebellion: Yet it is plain enough, that the greateſt part of them did heretofore, and it is to be feared that under pretence of Oppoſing Hypocriſie, they do ſtill rail and revile vertuous Prieſts and Prelates (whoſe Lives are continual Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) for Piety and Godlineſs. And were heretofore, and it is to be feared are ſtill Enemies to Godly Magiſtrates, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom they have nothing juſtly to Object, but their laudable endeavours in ſeeking to reclaim them from their prophaneneſs and ungodlineſs. It is a thing greatly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that they who are guilty of diſſoluteneſs and debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and are openly Prophane Perſons, wicked without ſhew of the contrary: It is, I ſay, a thing greatly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that they would be perſwaded to believe it. It is not others often abuſing of Holy and Religious Exerciſes, that hath ſet off their hearts from a Love of Piety and Godlineſs, but it is their own diſ-uſing themſelves from, and not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming themſelves to Holy and Religious Exerciſes, that cauſeth them to loath them themſelves, and maketh them hate and deteſt them in others. And their prophaning God's Sabbaths by ſwilling and bezeling, by Curſing and Swearing, thoſe beaſtly Vices which cauſe them to be taken up in the Lips of talkers, and branded with a Note of Infamy; what is the Reaſon that they do not daily and continually Repent of thoſe ſins, that ſo they ſhould prevail againſt them, and get ground of them every day? But becauſe they will not hearken to the good Inſtructions of God's Miniſters perſwading them to leave them: Nor Obey the wholſome Laws of Godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſeeking to reclaim them from them: But eſpecially becauſe they will not hearken to the good Motions of God's
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50882:18"/> Spirit moving them to Repentance, but put off God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with delays and procraſtinations. Well, if all theſe means do not work upon them, to cauſe them to leave theſe ſins, conſtantly and continually to Repent of them, and daily to practiſe Piety, and Serve God in publick, in private. If God have not already, it is much to be feared that he will e're long give up ſome of them unto a feared Conſcience, a heart that cannot Repent: And this Spiritual Judgment they will find it to be worſe than all Temporal Judgments and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever. Briefly, for a Concluſion, among thoſe that Covet an Opinion of Holineſs, and deſire to be reputed Saints, there be many Hypocrites. And of thoſe ſinners of whom our Saviour ſpeaketh in the Goſpel, <hi>That he came not to call the Righteous, but them to Repentance;</hi> there are but few true Penitents who conſtantly Repent of their ſins, and have any ſetled Acquaintance with God by Prayer. So that what with openly prophane Perſons on the one ſide, and ungodly Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites on the other ſide, the Peace of the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is ſo much troubled and diſquieted, that if God help not, it is not in the Power of Man to Remedy and redreſs thoſe things. If the Lord of the Sabbath do not cauſe his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths more carefully to be Sanctified, and bring it to paſs that Holy and Religious Exerciſes on the Lords day, on Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, on Week days be more in uſe than now they are. They that are true Chriſtians in moſt places had need to pray unto God, that they may keep a Sabbath unto him in Heaven, for there will be no keeping of Sabbath to him on Earth: And thus I ſhould paſs from this Alluſion, as the words put us in mind of a Sabbath that ſhould be kept to God on Earth, to ſpeak of them as they have reference to the Sabbath that ſhall be kept to God in Heaven.</p>

               <p>O <hi>Almighty Lord God, the Holy Lord God of Sabbath, thou ſearcheſt the Hearts, and tryeſt the Reins, and from thee no Secret can be hid: Thou ſeeſt and knoweſt that ſome there be, who under pretence of Religion, have, in a manner, Deſtroyed and over-thrown all Religion. They have cauſed thy Sabbaths to be deſpiſed, thy Worſhip and Service on Weeks, and on Holy-days to be neglected, and all publick Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances to be ſlighted and contemned. Forgive we beſeech thee, the multitudes that were heretofore, and are ſtill fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently circumvented, and ignorantly drawn in to be partakers in theſe things.

            <p>THeſe words are a Summary and brief Concluſion, and the Apoſtle doth infer and conclude from what he had before delivered, that the People of God ſhall be happy; and doth deſcribe that wherein their Happineſs doth conſiſt. Now then that you may ſee the Felicity of Gods choſen, rejoyce in the gladneſs of his People, and give thanks with his Inheritance, I ſhall propound unto you four Grounds of Doctrines to be inſiſted upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt Ground of Doctrine.</hi> In regard the reward that is promiſed unto us in the Life to come, is ſet forth unto us by the keeping of a Sabbath, I ſhall Obſerve unto you that the Happineſs and Felicity of Man conſiſteth in the Service of his Maker, in doing his Will, and keeping his Commandments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Ground of Doctrine.</hi> God ever had, now hath, and ever will have a People upon Earth, whoſe hearts are ſet upon this thing, and will by no means be taken off from Serving him, and glorifying their Creator.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Ground of Doctrine.</hi> Though the hearts of God's People be whole within them, and their intentions right pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and they intend the Service of God above all things, yet they have their failings and their fallings, their weakneſſes and Infirmities, and fall ſhort of their Duties, and their heart is not ſo right in all things that they ſhould attain unto this Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in this Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth Ground of Doctrine.</hi> That which muſt Comfort God's People againſt all diſcouragements, their fallings into ſin, and their failings in Duties, is the conſideration that ſuch a Happineſs they ſhall enjoy in the Life to come, ſuch a keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Sabbath remaineth unto them, that they ſhall never Offend God by ſinning againſt him, or fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
